			<em><strong>Guten Tag!</strong></em>  Arbeit is a web app that
			allows users to create and track projects and their associated
			tasks.  Of course, its real purpose is not to handle projects
			and tasks, but to demonstrate a few more advanced features
			using Rails 4 as well as give Prof. H a chance to mess around
			with one of his favorite gems:
			<%= link_to "chronic", "https://github.com/mojombo/chronic" %>.

			are just SOL <em>unless</em> you can guess our secret sign-up page.</p>
